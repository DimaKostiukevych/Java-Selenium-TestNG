## Overview
My personal educational repository for creating testing framework using popular tools, in this case I will use:
+ Java
+ Selenium Web Driver
+ TestNG

Project will be build using *Maven* as software project management tool, with surefire plugin, which will help in future with integration in continuous integration tools like Jenkins. The goal for this project is to create complete framework which could be used in real implementations.
